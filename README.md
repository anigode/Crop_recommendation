Crop Recommendation Project
1.	Crop Recommendation This project implements a crop recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to recommend suitable crops based on various agricultural factors such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The analysis involves data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

3.	Introduction The aim of this project is to recommend crops based on soil and climatic conditions. It utilizes a dataset containing various features relevant to crop growth. The project employs data cleaning, normalization, and three machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to predict the best crop to plant.
4.	Installation To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required libraries. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.6 or above).
5.	Usage
o	Place your dataset CSV file (e.g., Crop_recommendation.csv) in the project directory.
o	Run the crop_recommendation.py script to execute the analysis.
o	The cleaned data will be saved as crop_data.csv in the project directory.
6.	Data
o	The project uses a dataset containing information on soil and climatic conditions, which includes features such as:
	N: Nitrogen content in the soil
	P: Phosphorus content in the soil
	K: Potassium content in the soil
	temperature: Average temperature in degrees Celsius
	humidity: Average humidity percentage
	ph: Soil pH level
	rainfall: Average rainfall in mm
	label: Crop type (target variable)
o	The script performs the following data preprocessing steps:
	Checks for missing values and visualizes correlations among numeric features.
	Encodes categorical variables using label encoding.
	Scales feature values to normalize the data.
7.	Models The following machine learning models are implemented in this project:
o	Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based model that splits data into branches based on feature conditions.
o	Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy through averaging predictions.
o	Logistic Regression: A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
Each model is evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports.
8.	Evaluation The performance of each model is evaluated based on:
o	Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
o	Classification Report: A detailed report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
9.	Libraries The project depends on the following Python libraries:
o	pandas
o	numpy
o	seaborn
o	matplotlib
o	sklearn
